  s.description = "mirahd\n======\n\n**mirahd** is a Mirah Daemon listening for your requests to compile something.\nWhen it receives one it does the job quickly. _Really quickly_.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jstepien/mirahd.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jstepien/mirahd)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nWe'll need:\n\n  * Bundler,\n  * Mirah, and as a result\n  * JRuby 1.6.\n\nFor your own comfort and sanity it is also advisable to install a Ruby\nimplementation with a reasonably short start up time. MRI or Rubinius\nare good candidates.\n\n    jruby -S bundle install\n    jruby -S rspec test\n    jruby -rubygems -I lib -S bin/mirahd --daemon\n    ruby -I lib bin/mirahd test/hello.mirah\n\nRationale\n---------\n\nMirah is a lovely language but its low compilation speed might be discouraging.\nUsing it in development based on a lot of small _code, test, refactor_ cycles\nmight be problematic. JVM's start up time and a lag introduced by compilation\nof Mirah's sources by JRuby add up to the sum we see below\302\271.\n\n    $ time mirahc test/hello.mirah > /dev/null # with disk's cache warmed up\n    18.60user 0.45system 0:11.85elapsed\n\nAfter the initial warm up JVM and JRuby are pretty fast. The goal of this\nproject is to make the JVM start once only and then reuse the existing process\nfor all subsequent compilation tasks.\n\nRun the daemon.\n\n    $ jruby -rubygems -I lib -S bin/mirahd --daemon\n\nThe first compilation is already quite quick.\n\n    $ time ruby -I lib -S bin/mirahd test/hello.mirah\n    0.05user 0.00system 0:00.89elapsed\n\nThen JVM's JIT comes into play. Here's the tenth compilation.\n\n    $ time ruby -I lib -S bin/mirahd test/hello.mirah\n    0.04user 0.00system 0:00.30elapsed\n\nTodo\n----\n\n  * Security. By being able to access the port DRb is listening on you\n    can `eval` whatever you want to. `$SAFE` won't work as it's unsupported\n    by JRuby.\n  * Enable users to specify the port number.\n  * Write tests covering a server running in a different directory then the\n    client. It won't be possible without spawning 2 separate processes.\n  * Support `--help` et al. command line arguments.\n  * Concurrency. Two compilation requests might interfere with each other,\n    especially due to changing the current working directory.\n\nCopyrights\n----------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jan St\304\231pie\305\204\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
